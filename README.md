# Geocaching App

## Mobile App Development - Final Project

The Geocaching App's objective is to allow users to view their location in relation to geocache locations and track their distance from them.
Users can create an account, sign in, view their location, view geocache locations and their distance from them, add new geocache locations, and track their distance as they get closer to a chosen geocache location.

This app was created in Android Studio using Java, XML, Google Maps services, and Google Firestore.
The main Java code is located in app > src > main > java/com/example/geocache.
